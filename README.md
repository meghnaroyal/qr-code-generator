This is my Computer Networks mini project which was done in my 4th semester
We have built a QR code generator using socket programming in python
we have used python programming for our project 
The following code first sets up a server on the localhost and then when we run the client code, there is a simple tkinter gui which asks for URL of any website.
After giving the URL, when we click generate, a QR code is generated for that given URL 
We have used python libraries like socketserver, http.server, urllib.parse, BytesIO for server
We have used python libraries like QRcode, tkinter, requests, PIL, IO
